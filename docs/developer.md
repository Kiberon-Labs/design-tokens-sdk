## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm i
   ```

2. Development:

    You will likely want to run the generate command to load the openapi.json spec and create the autogenerated code.
    
    ```bash
    npm run generate
    ```

   ```bash
   # Run with hot reload
   npm run dev
   
   # Watch mode with incremental builds
   npm run build:watch
   ```

3. Build:
   ```bash
   # Fast incremental build
   npm run build
   
   # Clean build (removes dist and rebuilds)
   npm run build:clean
   ```

4. Start production:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Code Quality:

    Note that we ignore most of the autogenerated code the for the linting and fixing 

   ```bash
   # Check for linting errors
   npm run check
   
   # Fix linting errors
   npm run fix
   ```

6. Testing:
   ```bash
   # Run tests in watch mode
   npm test
   
   # Run tests with coverage
   npm run test:coverage
   ```

## CI/CD

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The workflow:

1. Runs on pull requests to master
2. Checks code formatting and linting
3. Runs tests with coverage
4. Uploads coverage reports to Codecov
5. Performs SonarQube code quality analysis

To set up the CI/CD:

1. Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:
   - `CODECOV_TOKEN`: Your Codecov token
   - `SONAR_TOKEN`: Your SonarQube authentication token
   - `SONAR_HOST_URL`: Your SonarQube server URL

2. Enable GitHub Actions in your repository settings

3. Create a pull request to see the workflow in action

The workflow will provide:
- Code quality metrics
- Test coverage reports
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Code smell detection
- Technical debt analysis
